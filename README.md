### Features be wanted
1. ~~add flag texture and when right click show the flag~~

2. ~~can be destroyed by itself when click~~
2. ~~mines position randomly~~

13. space cube more white
2. when click space cube, then other space near it show too
5. maybe use whel control the distance between cubes not the distance between camera and parent objct

~~means the feature has already be achived~~


### Bugs

2. explosion is earlier than mine cube shows
3. ~~when use random mines position num cubes show wrong number~~

~~means the bugs has already be fixed~~

###Have Cool Ideas || Find Bugs?
1. count the near 27 cubes not 6 cubes now to make the game more playable
2. maybe make cube matrix not a cube but a cuboid with 3 rows in z axis

Contact me, we achieved / fix it together.
